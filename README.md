# SOFIA_AustralianClimate

How does Antarctic melt affect Australian Climate? 

SOFIA model intercomparison with prescribed meltwater experiments to imrpove understanding of the climate response to Antarctic mass loss.

Analysis focuses on quantifying the magnitude of the air temperature and precipitation response over Australia and the physical drivers linking the polar ocean with extratropical atmospheric change.

SOFIA *antwater* experiment included from the following models:
- access-esm1-5
- canesm5
- cesm2
- foci
- gfdl-cm4
- gfdl-esm4
- giss-e2-1-g
- hadgem3-gc31-ll
